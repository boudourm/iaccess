# iAccess

This site brings together all the minutes of meetings that have taken place so far within the framework of the iAccess project. This project concerns the management of access to sites such as factories, places of worship, hospitals, sports sites, shopping complexes, etc. The objective of the project is to develop the iAccess software within the framework of a consortium involving different stakeholders within different organizations (to date, IM2AG, Batemis, Bissis and Competis).
